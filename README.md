Regula-Falsi:-

The Regulaâ€“Falsi Method is a numerical method for estimating the roots of a 
polynomial f(x).   A value x replaces the midpoint in the Bisection Method 
and serves as the new approximation of a root of f(x).   The objective is 
to make convergence faster.   Assume that f(x) is continuous.
